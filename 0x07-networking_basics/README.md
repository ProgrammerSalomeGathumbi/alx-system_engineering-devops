The OSI Model, LAN, WAN, IP Address, TCP/UDP, Ports, and Network Testing:

The OSI Model is a conceptual model that defines a standard for communication between different devices in a network. It has seven layers, each with a specific function, and helps to ensure that devices from different manufacturers can communicate with each other.

The seven layers of the OSI Model are:

Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
Network Layer
Transport Layer
Session Layer
Presentation Layer
Application Layer
A LAN, or Local Area Network, is a network that covers a relatively small geographic area, such as a home, office, or school. It is typically used for connecting devices within the same building or campus.

A WAN, or Wide Area Network, is a network that covers a larger geographic area, such as a city, state, or country. It is typically used for connecting devices across multiple locations.

The Internet is a global network of networks that connects devices and allows them to communicate and share information.

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

Localhost is a hostname that refers to the local computer or device. It is often used for testing and development purposes.

A subnet is a portion of a larger network that has been divided into smaller networks for organizational or security reasons.

IPv6 was created to address the limited number of available IPv4 addresses and to provide improved security and functionality.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the two main data transfer protocols used for IP at the transport level on the OSI schema. TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of data, while UDP provides fast, unreliable delivery of data.

A port is a number used to identify a specific process or application on a device that is communicating over a network. It is typically used in conjunction with an IP address.

The port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS are:

SSH: 22
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
Ping is a tool/protocol that is often used to check if a device is connected to a network by sending a packet of data to the device and waiting for a response.
